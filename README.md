UX Case Study – Personalized Fashion Platform

# Boutique to Box 👗🤖

**My UX Design Project – Personalized Fashion Platform**  
I designed **Boutique to Box**, an innovative concept that reimagines how people shop for fashion online.  
It combines **3D avatar customization**, **AI-generated clothing designs**, and **seamless tailor connectivity** to reduce fit issues and create a personalized shopping experience.

## 🚀 Problem
Many online fashion shoppers face:
- Wrong size and poor fit → high return rates  
- Difficulty imagining how clothes will look on their body  
- Limited customization options → lack of personalization  

---

## 💡 My Solution
Boutique to Box solves these pain points through:
1. **3D Avatar Creation**  
   - Users create a lifelike avatar using their exact body measurements.  
   - Outfits can be previewed on the avatar before purchase.  

2. **AI-Generated Clothing Designs**  
   - AI suggests outfits based on style preferences (casual, ethnic, partywear).  
   - Users can mix-and-match fabrics, colors, and embroidery.  

3. **Tailor Connectivity**  
   - Finalized designs are sent directly to tailors/boutiques.  
   - Tailors receive exact measurements → reducing fit errors.  

4. **Seamless Checkout**  
   - Guest checkout enabled  
   - Transparent shipping/returns info

## 📐 My UX Process
- **Research**  
  - Conducted surveys with online shoppers  
  - Found that 70% of returns were due to fit issues, and 60% wanted customization  

- **Design**  
  - Created user flows and wireframes in Figma  
  - Focused on simplifying the journey: Avatar → Customize Outfit → Try On → Checkout  

- **Prototype**  
  - Built high-fidelity mockups in Figma  

- **Testing**  
  - Shared prototype with sample users for feedback  
  - Iterated based on ease-of-use and trust in purchase decisions
